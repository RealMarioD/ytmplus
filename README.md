*Note: Script only tested on Chrome and Firefox *(thanks sl0thi3)*, other browsers are not officially supported, but may still work.*

## Settings

You can bring up the settings by clicking on the cog in the top left, or by pressing **Ctrl + Backslash**. (**Ctrl + Å°** on a Hungarian layout.)

## What is ytmPlus?

The script originally started off as a simple background changer, that now offers multiple visual customizations for <https://music.youtube.com>

## Customizations include

- Changing background color (with optional gradient)
- Adding a customizable audio visualizer
- Anti-AFK feature, meaning music playback won't stop after a while if you don't interact with the site
- Disabling YouTube Premium promotions in the bottom left
- Skipping disliked songs
- Fixing weird padding with playlist
- Enabling hidden playback buttons
- Changing or removing the "Upgrade" button in the top navigation bar

## Plans

- Themes: Customize navbar, menu and font colors
- ~~REWRITE AND SPLIT MAIN FUNCTIONS INTO MULTIPLE FILES PLEASE MY EYES THIS WAS A MISTAKE~~ done 2023/03/17
- Dev server for easier testing
