# ytmPlus
Ever wanted some nice addons for YouTube Music? If yes, you are at the right place.
## How to Install:
1. Download and install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net) or [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey), depends on what browser you have. (Script is kinda broken on Firefox but it's a WIP, sorry!)
2. [Click here to install the script!](https://github.com/RealMarioD/ytmplus/raw/main/ytmplus.user.js)
## What is ytmPlus?
The script originally started off as a simple background changer, that now offers multiple visual customizations for https://music.youtube.com

## Customizations include:
- Changing background color (with optional gradient)
- Adding a customizable audio visualizer in the top navigation bar
- Anti-AFK feature, meaning music playback won't stop after a while if you don't interact with the site
- Disabling YouTube Premium promotions in the bottom left
- Skipping disliked songs
- Fixing weird padding with playlist
- Enabling hidden playback buttons
- Changing or removing the "Upgrade" button in the top navigation bar

## Settings
You can bring up the settings by clicking on the cog in the top left, or by pressing **Ctrl + Backslash**. (**Ctrl + Å°** on a Hungarian layout.)
