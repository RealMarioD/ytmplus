# Alpha V3

Hey! If you are seeing this, you are on the staging branch (or looking at commit history, hi!)

This is an alpha version of V3, which includes kind of rewriting ytmPlus (again) to be easier to develop.

There are a lot of things that can, should and will be improved soon:tm:

**I personally can't recommend installing this version. It's still a WIP, might have more bugs and doesn't represent the V3 I envisioned.**

If you'd still like to, go to dist folder, click `ytmplus.user.js`, then click `Raw` above the code to quick install it.

# ytmPlus

Ever wanted some nice addons for YouTube Music? If yes, you are at the right place.

Multiple Language support!
(Currently there's only English and Hungarian only.)

# How to Install

1. Download and install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net) or [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey), depends on what browser you have.
2. [Click here to install the script!](https://github.com/RealMarioD/ytmplus/raw/main/dist/ytmplus.user.js)

*Note: Script only tested on Chrome and Firefox **(thanks sl0thi3)**, other browsers are not officially supported, but may still work.*

# Customization

You can bring up the settings by clicking on the cog in the top left, or by pressing **Ctrl + Backslash**. (**Ctrl + Å°** on a Hungarian layout.)

## Customizations include

- Changing background color (with optional gradient)
- Customizable audio visualizers
- Anti-AFK feature, meaning music playback won't stop after a while if you don't interact with the site
- Disabling YouTube Premium promotions in the bottom left
- Skipping disliked songs
- Fix the horrible layout on player page (somewhat)
- Enabling hidden playback buttons
- Changing or removing the "Upgrade" button in the top navigation bar
