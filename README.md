# V3 Beta

Due to breaking changes on YouTube Music's side, I'm pushing out V3 earlier than I'd wanted to, thus the "beta" tag.

# ytmPlus

Ever wanted some nice addons for YouTube Music? If yes, you are at the right place.

Multiple Language support!
(Currently there's only English and Hungarian only.)

# How to Install

1. Download and install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net) or [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey), depends on what browser you have.
2. [Click here to install the script!](https://github.com/RealMarioD/ytmplus/raw/main/dist/ytmplus.user.js)

*Note: Script only tested on Chrome and Firefox **(thanks sl0thi3)**, other browsers are not officially supported, but may still work.*

# Customization

You can bring up the settings by clicking on the cog in the top left, or by pressing **Ctrl + Backslash**. (**Ctrl + Å°** on a Hungarian layout.)

## Customizations include

- Changing background color (with optional gradient)
- Customizable audio visualizers
- Anti-AFK feature, meaning music playback won't stop after a while if you don't interact with the site
- Disabling YouTube Premium promotions in the bottom left
- Skipping disliked songs
- Fix the horrible layout on player page (somewhat)
- Enabling hidden playback buttons
- Changing or removing the "Upgrade" button in the top navigation bar
