# ytmplus
Ever wanted some nice addons for YouTube Music? If yes, you are at the right place.
## How to Install:
1. Download and install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net) or [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey), depends on what browser you have.
2. [Click here to install the script!](https://github.com/RealMarioD/ytmplus/raw/main/ytmplus.user.js)
## What does YTM+ offer?
With YTM+, you can:
> Change the background to a color scheme you like.
>
> Change the Upgrade button at the top to show the time (with fancy colors if you want to!)
>
> Fix some weird padding that I can see in 1080p, but can't in 4k, you should check it out, maybe you don't need this.
>
> Put an audio visualizer *(you know, the bars that react to sound!)* at the top of the site and kinda customize its colors.

## Customize
You can easily bring up the settings by pressing **Ctrl + Backslash**. (**Ctrl + Å°** on a Hungarian layout.) I'll probably change this later.
